# Amazon Product Recommender System

## Overview

This project implements an Amazon product recommender system, designed to provide personalized or popular product suggestions. The system likely involves components for scraping product data from Amazon, building a recommendation model, and exposing recommendations through a web API. The `api.py` script serves as the main entry point for interacting with the recommendation engine.

## Features (Inferred)

Based on the file names, the system is expected to offer the following functionalities:

* **Amazon Product Data Scraping:** The `amazon_scraper.py` script suggests capabilities for extracting product information (e.g., product details, reviews, ratings) from Amazon.

* **Recommendation Model:** The `Model.py` and `prod_recommender.py` files indicate the presence of a machine learning model responsible for generating product recommendations. This could be based on various techniques like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach.

* **Recommendation API:** The `api.py` script is likely a RESTful API that allows other applications or frontends to request and receive product recommendations.

* **Data Handling:** The presence of various `.json` and `.csv` files (e.g., `Fender Squier.json`, `laptop.json`, `nmve.csv`) suggests that the system processes and stores product-related data.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured with several key Python scripts and data files:

* `api.py`: The main script, likely implementing the web API for serving recommendations.

* `amazon_scraper.py`: Script responsible for scraping product data from Amazon.

* `Model.py`: Contains the core logic for the recommendation model.

* `prod_recommender.py`: Possibly a utility or wrapper script for the recommendation generation process.

* `.venv/`: Virtual environment folder (typical for Python projects).

* `__pycache__/`: Python's bytecode cache.

* `.json` and `.csv` files: Store scraped product data and possibly processed datasets (e.g., `Fender Squier.json`, `laptop.json`, `nmve.csv`, `electric guitar fender_scraped_data.csv`).

* `Groq_api.py`: Potentially an integration with the Groq API, possibly for natural language processing or advanced model serving.

* `cuda_test.py`: A script to test CUDA compatibility, suggesting the use of GPU for potentially compute-intensive tasks (e.g., model training).

* `fast_scraper.py`: An alternative or optimized scraping script.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these general steps. (Specific dependencies will need to be identified from the code itself, as a `requirements.txt` file was not directly accessible.)
